ðŸ‘¤ OMAR - Introduction and Context (50 seconds)

Script:

(Start with smile and eye contact)

"Good morning everyone. Today we're excited to present an innovative system for automating identification processes."

(Gestures toward screen)

"In many environments like financial institutions, government services, or access control, there's a constant need to quickly and reliably verify identity documents."

(Change tone, more emphatic)

"Our team has developed a solution that uses computer vision to identify and validate Mexican INE documents in real-time, combining advanced image processing techniques with artificial intelligence."

(Points to next speaker)

"To explain how it works technically, I'll hand over to Tello."

ðŸ‘¤ TELLO - Technical Architecture (60 seconds)

Script:

(Stands next to screen with technical diagram)

"Thank you, Omar. The system consists of three main modules that work together."

(Uses pointer to indicate diagram)

"First, the capture module uses OpenCV to obtain real-time video. Then we apply a series of filters: grayscale conversion, blur to reduce noise, and adaptive thresholding to improve contrast."

(Shows code example)

"The heart of the system is the Tesseract OCR engine, specifically configured to recognize Spanish text. Finally, the validator looks for specific patterns like NAME, ADDRESS, CURP, and DATE OF BIRTH."

(Gestures toward demo)

"To show you the system in action, Cesar will perform a live demonstration."

ðŸ‘¤ CESAR - Live Demonstration (70 seconds)

Script:

(Sits in front of computer with camera)

"Perfect. Now let's see the system working. Here we have the active interface capturing real-time video."

(Moves document in front of camera)

"You can observe the green rectangle that marks the optimal capture area. I'm positioning the document within this frame..."

(Presses S key)

"When I press the S key, the system processes the current frame. We immediately apply the preprocessing filters that Tello mentioned."

(Points to terminal/console)

"In the console we can see the extracted text after cleaning... and now... confirmation! The system has correctly identified all four required fields."

(Stands up)

"This multiple validation gives us high reliability in recognition. Raul will explain what makes our solution special."

ðŸ‘¤ RAUL - Value Proposition and Innovation (60 seconds)

Script:

(Stands center with comparison slide)

"Excellent demonstration, Cesar. What distinguishes our system are four key innovations:"

(Counts on fingers)

"One: Real-time processing that eliminates the need for static scans. Two: Specialized configuration for Mexican documents, not a generic solution."

(Changes slide)

"Three: Accessibility - works with any standard webcam. And four: Adaptive algorithms that adjust to different lighting conditions."

(Shows metrics)

"We've achieved 85% accuracy in controlled conditions, with processing times under 100 milliseconds per frame."

(Points to final speaker)

"To conclude, Alonso will share the most valuable learnings from this project."

ðŸ‘¤ ALONSO - Competencies and Conclusions (50 seconds)

Script:

(Stands front with eye contact to audience)

"This project was much more than developing software; it was a comprehensive learning experience."

(Speaks with conviction)

"We developed generic competencies like effective teamwork and technical communication, but also specific competencies from our career: software engineering, digital image processing, and intelligent systems."

(Inspirational tone)

"We've demonstrated that it's possible to create accessible solutions using open-source technologies, bringing classroom theory to real-world applications."

(Includes entire team with gesture)

"On behalf of Omar, Tello, Cesar, Raul, and myself, we thank you for your attention and we're ready to answer your questions."
